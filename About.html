<h1>Charlotte Joublot Ferré</h1>

    <p>Charlotte Joublot Ferré is a doctoral student in the French Department where she also works as a lecturer. Before
        coming to the United States, Charlotte Joublot Ferré completed her master's degree in French and Francophone
        literature at Sorbonne-Université (Paris). During this time, she wrote two theses on Francophone literature in
        the South Pacific, first a reading of Chantal Spitz's novel, L'île des rêves écrasés – Island of Shattered
        Dreams, the first indigenous novel translated in English- and then L'écriture de l'identité dans la littérature
        francophone du Pacifique Sud: une étude comparative (Writing Identity in Oceanian Francophone Literatures). She
        became a certified teacher of French language and literature in 2014. She is interested in postcolonial studies,
        particularly in traditional and contemporary indigenous literature from the South Pacific and specifically from
        French Polynesia, which is the focus of her current doctoral work. She is also interested in digital humanities
        and is working, under the guidance of Professor Maria Solomon, on a project for a digital critical edition of
        the Revue des colonies, a 19th century abolitionist journal edited by Martinique politician Cyrille Bissette.
